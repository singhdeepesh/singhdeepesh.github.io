## About Me
I'm a 2nd year PhD student working in the School of Mathematics and Physics at the University of Queensland. I'm supervised by Dr. Austin Lund, Dr. Peter Rohde, and Prof. Timothy Ralph on the broad topic of Photonic quantum computation. My research interests lie at the intersection of linear optical quantum computing, computational complexity theory, representations of groups and algebras, and classical invariant theory.
