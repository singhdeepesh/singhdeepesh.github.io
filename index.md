## About me
I'm a 2nd year PhD student working in the School of Mathematics and Physics at University of Queensland. I'm supervised by Dr. Austin Lund, Dr. Peter Rohde, and Prof. Timothy Ralph on the broad topic of Photonic quantum computation. My research intersections lie at the intersection of linear optical quantum computing, computational complexity theory, representations of groups and algebras, and classical invariant theory. 

## Current Projects
1. Optical implementation of Grover's search algorithm (with Prof. Andrew White)
2. Polynomial invariants of linear optics (with Dr. Austin Lund)

## Academic Qualifications
1. B.Tech (Hons) in Engineering Physics - IIT Bombay (India), 2015-19
2. PhD in Physics - University of Queensland (Australia), 2021-present

## Publications
1. Optical cluster-state generation with unitary averaging. [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15282)
2. QuNet: Cost vector analysis & multi-path entanglement routing in quantum networks  [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00418)
